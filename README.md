MacGyver
Project number 3 Python OpenClassrooms

Macgyver is trapped in a 5-level maze and must pick up all the objects that fell randomly by level on the ground to get rid of the guard. Then go to the goalie to put the guard to sleep to win the game, or you will lose.
Launch the game with "python3 main.py"
